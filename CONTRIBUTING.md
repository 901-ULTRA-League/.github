# Contributing to 901 ULTRA League

Thank you for your interest in contributing!
Our community operates on collaboration, respect, and shared passion for the ULTRAMAN Trading Card Game. This document outlines expectations, contribution processes, and standards to ensure consistent, high-quality development across our projects.

📌 Ways to Contribute

We welcome contributions in many forms, including:

If you're unsure where to begin, start by exploring open Issues labeled:

🛠 Development Workflow
1. Fork the Repository

Create a fork of the project you want to contribute to and clone it locally.

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git

2. Create a Feature Branch

Use a descriptive name that matches the change:

git checkout -b feature/add-deck-filter

3. Commit Using Clear Messages
git commit -m "Added advanced deck filtering"


Follow conventional commit principles when possible (e.g., feat:, fix:, docs:).

4. Push and Open a Pull Request
git push origin feature/add-deck-filter


Then open a PR against the appropriate branch (typically main).

📑 Pull Request Guidelines

Before submitting a Pull Request:

Ensure your code passes all linting and formatting checks

Add tests where applicable

Update documentation if your change introduces new behavior

Reference related Issues (e.g., Resolves #42)

Provide a concise summary of what changed and why

All major changes should be discussed in an Issue before development begins to avoid duplicate work.

⚙ Code Standards

While standards may vary by project, common guidelines include:

Standard	Requirement
Formatting	Follow language-appropriate formatting tools (Black, Prettier, clang-format, etc.)
Type Safety	Use type hints / interfaces where supported
Commit Style	Prefer Conventional Commits
Documentation	Docstrings and README updates for all public features
Testing	Unit tests for core logic when feasible

Each repository may include additional rules in its own README or .editorconfig.

🧪 Testing Requirements

When contributing executable code:

Include tests for new features

Do not break existing test suites

Aim for meaningful coverage, not partial stubs

Document any test data assumptions

If a project uses CI/CD, your PR must pass pipelines before being merged.

🧭 Project Alignment

Projects should support the goals of the organization:

Enhancing ULTRAMAN TCG accessibility and tooling

Improving community engagement and gameplay resources

Non-commercial, fan-driven development

Respect for IP owners and legal boundaries

If a contribution doesn’t align with these principles, maintainers may request revisions.

🛡 Community Expectations

All contributors must follow the Code of Conduct.
Disrespectful behavior, harassment, or exploitation of community spaces will not be tolerated.

We aim to embody the spirit of an Ultra — unity, integrity, support, and camaraderie.
